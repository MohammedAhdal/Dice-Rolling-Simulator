"""
Python 2 - Guess the Number
The program will first randomly generate an integer number between (1 -9) unknown to the user. 
The user needs to guess what that number is.
The program will compare the user's guessed number to the program's generated number
If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication appear.
If the user's guess is wrong, the program will ask the user to input another number (higher or
 lower based on the comparison)
